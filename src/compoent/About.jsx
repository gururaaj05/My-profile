    Hello, my name is Gururaaj A. I have 1.5 years of experience in programming and algorithms, focusing on full-stack software development. 
    I completed a 2-month certified internship at Emglizt Technology Limited, where I gained practical knowledge in basic Python programming. 
    Additionally, I hold certifications in Java and C++.These certifications and my internship experience have significantly enhanced my problem-solving skills and understanding of error handling. 
    I am now eager to delve into MERN stack technology to further improve my development knowledge.
